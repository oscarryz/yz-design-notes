There's no constants, but the convention is to use all upper case. 

The compiler doesn't enforce it, so just don't change it 

#open-question  Should the compiler enforce immutable with all upper case? #answered No

```js
math: {
    PI: 3.141516
}
...
Circle: {
    r Real
    area: {
        math.PI * r ** 2
    }
}
```
