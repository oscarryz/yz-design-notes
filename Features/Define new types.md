If we have a new type `Person`  


```js
Person : {}
```

The current option suggested by [Instances](Replaced%20features/Instances.md) (I think) is to see if it was defined earlier, but that doesn't seem to be enough. 

## Summary

- Only allowed in uppercase starting identifiers
- Use `:` to infer a new type
