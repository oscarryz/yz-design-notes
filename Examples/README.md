This is a place to put examples of what Yz would / could look like and identify shortcomings. 

Most of the "inspiration" is try to replicate what other programming languages do, the files are named _lang - example_  with a link to the original example. When there's no original it would be: _Yz - example_. 


In the future all of these should work, at the time of this writing is all in my imagination.
