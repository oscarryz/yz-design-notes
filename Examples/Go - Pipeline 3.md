In a loop: 

- Produce numbers
- Square them
- Print them
-
The producer knows when to stop 

```js

// WORKS
// To make it work as close as possible, the squarer needs to invoke the counter // until it closes. The counter needs to know when to stop
`
Creates a block that returns an Int and a Bool every times it's invoked.
It will continue to be invoked while n < 100
This counter is the "producer"
`
counter: { 
	n: -1
	{ 
	    n < 100 ? {n = n + 1 } 
	    n < 100 
	    n 
	}

}
squarer: {
	producer (Int ; Boolean)  //e.g. the counter
	consumer (Int)

	value Int
	open  Bool
	is_open: { 
	    value open = producer()
	}
	// while calls a block `is_open`.. similar to
	// while { is_open() } but better because it 
	// doesn't need to create an extra block
	while is_open { 
		consumer (value * value)
	}
}
printer: {
	n Int 
	print '$(n)'
}
main: {
   squarer( counter() printer )
}
```


```javascript

// DOESNT_WORK
// The counter takes a "channel" which is a block that receives an Int
// it produces a number and sends it to the channel 
counter (out (Int)) = {
	channel (Int)
	1.to(100).each { 
		e Int
		out(e) // send e to the channel
	}
} 
// The squarer takes a "channel" (a block that takes an int)
// where to send the data and returns a block that expects an int;
// that's how the producer and the printer 
// gets connected.
squarer: {
	out (Int)
	{   
		v Int 
		out ( v * v )
	}
}
// The printer is a block that takes an Int and prints it
printer: { 
	n Int 
    print "$(n)"
}
main: {
	producer(squarer(printer)) 
}

//
// Another approach that ressambles the actual Go code but doesn't work
// 
counter: {
	out (Int)
	1.to(100).each { e Int ; out(e) }
}
squarer: {
	in (Int)
	out (Int)
	v: in()
	out(v * v)
}
printer: {
  in (Int)
  v: in()
  print '$(v)'
}
main: {
    naturals : (n Int; n)
    squares  : (n Int; n)
    counter(naturals)
    squarer(naturals squares)
    printer(squares)
}

// The reson it doesn't work is because the block `(Int)` by itself cannot stop for the value to be overriden before is read (channels do), it can block until the value is avaiable which is righ away.
// It would work if a buffer is used to store the values so it is not overriden

```
